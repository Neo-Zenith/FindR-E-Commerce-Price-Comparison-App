NOISE CANCELLING
Yes

Industry-leading noise cancellation – now even better
Everything in the WF-1000XM4 headphones has been designed from the ground up. Like our new Integrated Processor V1, specially developed by Sony, that cancels more noise than ever, a new driver unit with more performance, noise sensing microphones, and innovative Noise Isolation Earbud Tips with a more stable fit.

Integrated Processor V1
Specially developed by Sony, our new Integrated Processor V1 takes the noise cancelling performance of our acclaimed QN1e chip and goes even further. Improved noise cancelling performance and Bluetooth ‘System on Chip’ technology delivers the industry’s highest level of noise cancelling yet uses less power.

High performance dual noise sensor microphones
Two noise sensing microphones per ear – one feed-forward and one feed-back – on the surface of the headphones catch more of the ambient sounds of your surroundings, whether it’s in-flight noise, city traffic or office chatter.

New 6mm driver unit
A newly designed 6mm driver unit, featuring a 20% increase in magnet volume, gives you improved performance in low frequencies. It also enhances noise cancelling by generating a high-precision cancellation signal to the low frequency range.

Noise Isolation Earbud Tips
Newly developed Noise Isolation Earbud Tips feature a unique polyurethane foam material. Soft and elastic, it maximises the surface contact area between the earbud tip and the ear canal, eliminating gaps to insulate sound and reduce noise. It also improves adhesion to the ear canal for a more stable fit, making the WF-1000XM4 headphones easy to wear.

Minimising wind noise
Even on windy days you’ll stay totally immersed. Automatic Wind Noise Reduction mode detects when it’s windy and automatically suppresses it.

Hear more of what’s around you
In Ambient Sound mode, the WF-1000XM4 headphones capture more of the sound around you than ever before, which means you get a more natural listening experience and stay connected to your environment.

Exceptional sound quality
The WF-1000XM4 now supports High-Resolution Audio Wireless . Thanks to specially designed 6mm drivers, they reproduce a dynamic sound despite their small size, and the high compliance diaphragm reproduces a rich bass range. The Integrated Processor V1 also enhances sound quality and reduces distortion, and enables LDAC codec processing and DSEE Extreme.

Enjoy High-Resolution Audio without wires
The WF-1000XM4 now supports High-Resolution Audio Wireless , thanks to LDAC, our industry-adopted audio coding technology. LDAC transmits approximately three times more data (at the maximum transfer rate of 990 kbps) than conventional Bluetooth® audio, allowing you to enjoy High-Resolution Audio content in exceptional quality, as close as possible to that of a dedicated wired connection.

Real-time restoration of all your compressed files
Using Edge-AI (Artificial Intelligence), DSEE Extreme™ (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) upscales compressed digital music files in real time. Dynamically recognising instrumentation, musical genres, and individual elements of each song, such as vocals or interludes, it restores the high-range sound lost in compression for a richer, more complete listening experience.

Smarter talking, smarter listening
As soon as you speak to someone, Speak-to-Chat automatically pauses the music and lets in ambient sound so you can conduct a conversation – handy if you want to keep your headphones on, or your hands are full. And once your chat is over, your music starts playing again automatically. Speak-to-Chat recognises and reacts to your voice. It is based on Precise Voice Pickup Technology, which combines four microphones and sensors with advanced audio signal processing.

Adaptive Sound Control automatically adjusts to your situation
Adaptive Sound Control is a smart function that senses where you are and what you’re doing – for example, travelling, walking or waiting – then adjusts ambient sound settings for the ideal listening experience.

Headphones that get to know you
You can opt to have Adaptive Sound Control learn to recognise places that you frequently visit, like your office, the gym, or a favourite café, and tailor sound to suit the situation.

Superior call quality
Precise Voice Pickup Technology uses beamforming microphones and a bone-conduction sensor to allow the WF-1000XM4 h",$0.00

★Industry-leading noise cancellationWhether you’re flying long-haul or relaxing in a café, the WH-1000XM4 headphones deliver our best ever noise cancelling performance, keeping out even more high and mid frequency sounds.
★The technology that makes it happenDual noise sensor technology, featuring two microphones on each earcup, captures ambient noise and passes the data to the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1. Using a new algorithm, the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1 then applies noise cancelling processing in real time to a range of acoustic environments. Working together with a new Bluetooth® Audio SoC (System on Chip), it senses and adjusts to music and noise signals, as well as acoustic characteristics between the driver unit and ears, at over 700 times per second.
★Optimising noise cancellingTo maximise noise cancelling performance, the WH-1000XM4 headphones incorporate two technologies: Personal Noise Cancelling Optimiser, designed specifically for you, and Atmospheric Pressure Optimising, designed specifically for air travel.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Headphones

Must read before you buy:
misodiko's upgraded series earpads are significantly thicker than the original ones
in order to make it more comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
And they will also change the sound by increasing the distance between your ears and the drivers.
Some people like this change and some people don't. This is a subjective feeling.
In short, if you don't want the earpads change the sound in any way, please don't buy it.",$0.00
