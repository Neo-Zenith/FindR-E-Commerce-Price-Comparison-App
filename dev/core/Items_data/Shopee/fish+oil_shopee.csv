On the one hand there are inexpensive low quality fish oils type that you find in the supermarket that contain little of the two fatty acids - EPA and DHA who are responsible your cardiovascular and psychiatric benefits.

On the other hand there are high-quality brands like Nordic Naturals which are very expensive but also have very high amounts of EPA and DHA. NOW Foods Ultra Omega is 4 times cheaper than the Nordic Naturals brand per unit of DHA/EPA and 50% cheaper than Kirkland Signature's product. There's no need to go for a product that is 3 to 4 times more expensive unless brand is very important to you.

According to NOW's website its fish oil is molecularly distilled and thus free of contaminants. Because of the usage of small fish (mackeral, anchovies, sardines) instead of larger fish, virtually no environmental toxins. Also worth mentioning is that the high ratio of EPA (500mg) to DHA (250mg) in one softgel (75% OMEGA-3 in each softgel !!). You only need to take 1 a day.

Most fish oil softgels have a lot less concentration and you have to take 6 or more per day, but not with these. NOW Foods Ultra Omega softgels are easy on your stomach, with no nausea or reflux, due to the enteric coating which prevents digestion in the stomach and delays it until the softgel reaches the small intestine where it will be absorbed. You will be delighted that good quality, concentrated fish oil is more affordable and thus more available, because the health benefits are amazing.",$0.00
