These high quality Slazenger tennis balls offer unbelievable levels of visibility, widely considered the best in tennis.
Since 1979, Wilson has been the only ball that has held the distinction of being the ""Official Ball of the U.S. Open"". Constructed of premium high-grade wool that is woven into a thicker, denser felt, the Wilson U.S. Open tennis ball is known for its superior playability, consistency and durability.
The Fort Elite tennis balls from the high-quality tennis brand, Dunlop, are gas-filled tennis balls. The gas-filled tennis balls are the most used tennis ball in competitions and tournaments. In comparison to a pressure-free tennis ball, a gas-filled ball is more comfortable for tennis. For example, a gas-filled tennis ball is very light on the racket which makes playing more comfortable. In addition, the slight drop on the racket also causes a gas-filled tennis ball to be less susceptible to injury. Fluorescent felt is used on the tennis ball so that you can see the tennis ball better compared to others. The tennis balls are delivered in a pressurised tube. This ensures that the gas filled with the ball can not escape the tennis ball. In addition, the Fort Elite is also equipped with an HD Core technology, which also contributes to a longer life span.
