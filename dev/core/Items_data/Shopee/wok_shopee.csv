USE AND CARE:Before use:Please follow these instructions to prolong the product life and to maintain the optimal performance of your La gourmet® Nitriding Wok.
1. Conditioning the cast iron wok with oil before it is used for the first time is very important.2. BEFORE USE First wash your pan’s inner and outer surface with some dish washing liquid. Rinse and dry it.3. After drying the pan, please follow the oil conditioning procedure.4. Initial Oil Conditioning5. Fill the pan with one cup of oil.6. Heat the pan for approximately 5 minutes using low heat or until the pan is smoking hot.7. Coat the entire interior cookware by tilting the pan and turn the oil around.8. Turn off the heat and remove the oil from the pan. The oil can be kept in an oil pot for repeated seasoning. CAUTION: Pan is very hot9. Using a soft towel, spread and work the remaining oil residue evenly into the pan surface.10. Initial oil conditioning is completed and the pan is ready to be used.
CAUTION: PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN HANDLING AND USING HEATED OIL.
BEFORE EVERY USE:1. Routine oil conditioning must always be performed before each use.2. Performing oil conditioning before each use prevents food from sticking and makes cooking and cleaning much easier.3. This is something that most professional cooks know and do. With proper conditioning, the cookware will form a natural patina and will resist food from sticking, making cooking and cleaning easier.
Routine Oil Conditioning:- Heat up your pan using medium heat.- Add about ½ cup of oil to the pan (you can reuse the oil from the first conditioning).- Tilt the pan and turn the oil around to coat the entire interior surface.- After the oil is heated and the pan is evenly coated and conditioned, return the oil to its oil pot.- The pan is ready for cooking. Please add fresh oil for your usual cooking. *Oil conditioning prevents food from sticking while creating a coating which allows heat to be distributed more evenly on the pan surface.
AFTER USE:1. Use a scrub brush while the cookware is still hot and wash the pan with water/hot water. (Avoid using the dishwasher and dish soap as it may strip away the protective coating)2. When done rinse it off and wipe off any moisture from both interior and exterior of the cookware.The cookware should be properly dried before storing.
**REMINDER:- Make sure to perform routine oil conditioning before each use.- Using a detergent may strip away the protective coating acquired from oil conditioning.- Should the pan require deep cleaning with a detergent, apply oil evenly to the surface after cleaning.- Reperforming initial oil conditioning is recommended before use.

• SUPER B SINGAPORE • 
We are the official Super B cookware supplier and are selling authentic Super B hard anodized cookware. Upholding the belief that non-chemically coated cookware are healthier and more durable, we have been committed to selling hard anodized cookware since 1987. For more info, please visit: www.superb-cookware.com or look for ""Super B Cookware"" on www.youtube.com.

• ABOUT HARD ANODIZED COOKWARE • 
Hard anodized cookware is similar to the traditional chinese wok, except that it is lighter, less smoky and does not rust. It is made of a steel alloy that has undergone an electrical treatment to form a scratch-resistant oxidized surface twice as hard as stainless steel. This non-toxic oxidized surface is integral to the metal body and does not peel off with prolonged use. Being non-porous, the anodized surface prevents metals from leaching into food when cooking, ensuring the cookware is safe to use. Although not chemically coated with a non-stick layer, hard anodized cookware can become non-stick if heated until sufficiently hot before cooking. 

• BENEFITS OF HARD ANODIZED COOKWARE • 
- No chemical coating: healthier and free from toxic chemicals such as PFOA and PTFE used in non-stick cookware 
- Hard, scratch-resistant surface: allows for the use of metal spatulas and utensil, as well as cooking of hard-shelled foods such as crabs
- Withstands high heat: absence of a non-stick coating ensures pan does not peel or blister after prolonged use on high heat
- Can be washed when hot: hard anodized cookware can be washed when hot without any damage to its surface
- Fast and even heat distribution: hard anodized cookware heat up quickly and evenly, reducing cooking time and producing better cooking results
- Highly durable: average lifespan of hard anodized cookware is 4-5 times longer than non-stick cookware 

• WHO SHOULD GET HARD ANODIZED COOKWARE? •
- People who want cookware that's much more durable than non-stick cookware
- People who want healthier and PTFE-free cookware
- People who are willing to use oil in cooking and are willing to learn how to use hard anodized cookware (similar to the traditional cast iron wok, but easier to maintain)
- People who want to use metal utensils and cook hard-shell foods like crabs
- People who want convenience (pan can be washed when hot unlike non-stick cookware)

• Perfect details --- Extra thick pot wall, hand-welded one-piece handle, joint reinforcement, will not fall off. Imported red eucalyptus handle, comfortable and durable, anti-scalding.

• No coating --- No chemical coating, less smoke, and easier cleaning than other iron pans

• Heavy-duty wok --- Traditional wok used by professional chefs, this Chinese wok is built to last and stand up to busy commercial kitchens. After factory pre-seasoning, your wok can be just like the one my mamma owned for decades.

• Harness the authentic Wok Taste (Hei) --- Premium carbon steel and heavy gauge body ensure fast heat up and superior heat distribution to the entire cooking surface. The Carbon Steel Wok is made of 100% cast iron, which retains heat better than other metals, COOKWARE. A good seasoning makes all the difference.

• Maintenance wok --- After each use, remember to dry the water droplets with a cotton cloth or dry it with a small fire to improve the service life and no rust, healthier.

Use and maintenance of handmade carbon steel wok:

1. After each use, after cleaning, the water inside the pot is baked with a small fire. 

2. After drying and applying a layer of cooking oil, can extend the service life and accelerate the process of raising the pot. 

3. If the iron rust, rust washed with steel balls, applying a layer of oil.

4. Can not use the iron pot to cook acidic fruits, such as bayberry, hawthorn, apple In summary, according to this method, the pot can be maintained black and bright, the more you use it, the true uncoated non-stick pan.

If the surface of the wok has some small scratches, this is normal for our wok because our wok is handmade throughout the manufacturing process, so we can't prevent this issue from occurring. Thank you for your understanding!!!!!!!
( Scratches have no effect on the use of the wok / healthy (food grade)
