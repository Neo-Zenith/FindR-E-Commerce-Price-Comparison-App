[SHORT PRODUCT DESCRIPTION]
The Monopoly Ultimate Rewards board game features an all in one electronic banking unit, and amps up the excitement with unique rewards! Each player has a bank card that will earn them different rewards for gameplay: roll a certain number, land on a certain space, or purchase a particular property. Players can also choose to fly to any property on the board, and force another player into trading one of their coveted properties. There is no paper money in this game -- the cards and banking unit track each player's cash. It's an exciting game as players buy properties, collect rent -- and get rewarded for it! The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.

The Hasbro, Hasbro Gaming, Parker Brothers, and Monopoly names and logos, the distinctive design of the gameboard, the four corner squares, the Mr. Monopoly name and character, as well as each of the distinctive elements of the board and playing pieces are trademarks of Hasbro for its property trading game and game equipment.
