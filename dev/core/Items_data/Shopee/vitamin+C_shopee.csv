Vitamin C is a water soluble nutrient well known for its vital role in the immune system. Vitamin C is also necessary for the production of collagen (a structural protein in connective tissue) and is therefore important for skin, bone, and joint health. Vitamin C is needed for amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and the utilization of many nutrients, such as folic acid and iron.

This product was specially formulated to provide a sustained release of Vitamin C and includes Rose Hips as an added source of Vitamin C.

3X BETTER ABSORPTION, SUPERIOR BLEND: Each serving contains a blend of Vitamin C, from one of the world’s leading providers of ascorbic acid, plus Citrus Bioflavonoids. This proprietary blend of Vitamin C provides daily antioxidant support to help defend cells against free radicals, to soothe inflammation and support healthy metabolism. This industry-leading formula allows for advanced absorption, enabling maximum delivery of your daily Vitamin C need – much better than regular vitamin C. 
GENTLER ON STOMACH, BUFFERED LOW ACIDITY: Vitamin C is naturally acidic and high doses may cause an upset stomach and loose stools. Biofinest Buffered Vitamin C avoids this effect by combining vitamin c with calcium, magnesium, and potassium. These minerals reduce the acidity of vitamin C, making it more gentle on the gut, suitable for those with sensitive stomach and for long term consumption. Buffered Vitamin C combines a highly absorbable form of vitamin C together with the buffering minerals to allow higher doses without stomach upset. 
GREAT TASTING CHEWABLE, HIGH POTENCY: Our chewable 500mg/1000mg Vitamin C tablets comes with great tasting natural orange taste, delivering amazing results. One tablet of Vitamin C chewables contains the same amount of vitamin C found in eight oranges. Our tables are covered with a layer of coating to protect them against dampness or bacteria, also prevents the supplement being released in the acidic conditions of the stomach before reaching the intestine, hence maximizing the efficacy and absorption. Your daily dose of vitamin C and minerals, in one easy-chewable tablet. 
POWERFUL IMMUNE BOOSTER: Biofinest Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) helps to support the growth, development and repair of all body tissues. It's involved in many body functions, including formation of collagen, absorption of iron, the proper functioning of the immune system, wound healing, and the maintenance of cartilage, bones, and teeth. Vitamin C helps in preventing common cold and flu, to protect against free radicals, to support brain function, cognition, cardiovascular, adrenal, and heart health, blood circulation, mood, bone density, helps decrease muscle soreness, and helps increase absorption of calcium & iron.
HEALTHY SKIN HAIR NAIL JOINT: Biofinest Vitamin C promotes collagen production, which enhances skin, nail, hair, and joint health. Collagen production, antioxidative properties, and immune support make vitamin C an important nutrient for supporting post-surgical healing and injury repair. Regular vitamin C intakes help to keep skin youthful and plump, maintain and repair damaged skin and cartilage, diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, brighten up complexion, reduce the appearance of dark spots, and prevent premature aging.
