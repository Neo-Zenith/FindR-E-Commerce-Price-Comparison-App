 About this item    Shower Exfoliator for Home Use - Experience Korean spa treatment at home. Our body-exfoliating scrub mitts provide full microdermabrasion to visibly lift away dead skin. Packaging may vary.    Love the Way Your Skin Feels - Our shower mitts give you the smoothest skin ever. When you use our exfoliating body scrubbers 2-4x a month, you’ll enjoy better product absorption, fewer bumps and ingrown hairs, and increased circulation.    Use as a Self-tan Remover - The 100% viscose construction of this microdermabrasion mitt makes it great for buffing out your self tanner without being too harsh. You can also use it to prep your skin before applying tanner.    Way Better than Loofahs or Chemical Exfoliants - Loofahs and chemical exfoliants don’t have the skin-gripping power of our viscose shower exfoliators, meaning they’re not as good at removing dead skin. Our mitts are rough enough to exfoliate deep, while soft enough to buff and smooth.    Reveal a Heavenly Glow - Use our Korean scrub mitts to fight back against dry, bumpy skin caused by keratosis pilaris. Your arms, legs, and body will look smoother and fresher than ever before.
