The oil is also highly purified, meaning all the nasties such as pollutants, saturated fat and cholesterol have been filtered out, leaving only the good stuff.

 About this item    WHAT IS KRILL OIL? What sets krill oil apart from standard fish oils is the presence of astaxanthin and marine phospholipids. Astaxanthin is a type of carotenoid and natural antioxidant that gives krill oil its deep red colour and protects its nutrients from oxidation. Marine phospholipids act as a natural emulsifier to aid in the digestion of the omega 3 fatty acids naturally present in the oil. These fatty acids are transported and integrated into cell membranes quicker and more efficiently.    WHY CHOOSE HEALTHSPAN'S SUPER STRENGTH KRILL OIL? Super Strength Krill oil is extracted exclusively from Euphausia superba, an Antarctic krill species rich in omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, as well as phospholipids, astaxanthin and choline. The phospholipid-bound omega 3 fatty acids are water dispersible, making them gentler on the stomach and better absorbed by the body, ensuring a successful delivery to key parts of your body, such as the brain, heart, eyes and liver.    QUALITY INGREDIENTS FIRST: Healthspan work harder to seek out the best-quality ingredients for their supplements. They source and manufacture their range, ensuring optimal purity and quality along the way so whether it is faster-acting, better-absorbed, filtered for optimal purity or simply contains more active ingredients, they're confident you won't find better quality.
