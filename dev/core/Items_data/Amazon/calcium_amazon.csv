Fully formed bone is a connective tissue matrix infiltrated with microscopic calcium hydroxyapatite crystals that confer considerable mechanical strength. The process of calcium deposition can occur only where a bone matrix is in place to accept it. This bone matrix is analogous to a grid of steel bars over which concrete is poured—the supportive framework provided by the matrix improves rigidity while making bones less susceptible to fracture. The bone matrix structure is primarily a web of large, fibrous collagen molecules. Calcium Bone Maker Complex supplies a very similarly composed, semi-assembled collagen web, in the form of ossein microcrystalline hydroxyapatite complex. This organically prepared bone extract includes collagen and the other bone matrix proteins, along with bone growth factors (small proteins that enhance bone growth and renewal.* The calcium in Calcium Bone Maker Complex is provided in the highly bioavailable form of microcrystalline hydroxyapatite. This formula also provides other trace minerals involved in bone matrix formation. Zinc is broadly required for the transcription of DNA to RNA, and for the translation of RNA into new bone proteins. Copper is an essential cofactor for the enzyme that helps crosslink collagen into the forming matrix. Manganese is required by enzymes that make matrix glycoproteins. Magnesium is supplied because magnesium metabolism is very tightly linked with calcium metabolism. This formula conforms to the widely recommended dietary “calcium-magnesium ratio” of 2:1 calcium: magnesium. Calcium Bone Maker Complex also includes vitamin D because it has become clear that taking calcium supplements without having sufficient vitamin D in the blood will not enhance bone health; vitamin D controls calcium utilization. Vitamin D sufficiency also improves calcium absorption. Vitamin D deficiency is a major public health problem worldwide. Among U.S. adults older than 65, some 40-100% are vitamin D insufficient.   Non-GMO/Gluten Free/Soy Free   Consult your healthcare provider before use if you are taking any prescription medications or if you have a medical condition.   Doctor’s best calcium bone maker complex promotes skeletal muscular and overall health.*
