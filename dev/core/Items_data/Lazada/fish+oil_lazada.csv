It helps to support heart and cardiovascular health and assist in the maintenance of normal eye and brain function. This is an ideal dietary supplement to take if you can't manage to eat the recommended 2-3 serves of fish a week. To ensure you can take Blackmores Fish Oil 1000 with confidence， Blackmores regularly tests its fish oil for mercury and only uses high quality fish oil without added artificial surfactants to disguise fishy odours.Fish oil is a source of the omega-3 essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are incorporated into every cell membrane in the body， in the form of compounds called phospholipids. Cell membranes play the vital role of regulating what goes into， and what comes out of each cell. The integrity and fluidity of the cell membrane is determined by the type of phospholipid that is available for the body to use. Cell membranes made up mainly of phospholipids derived from the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids are more fluid and function better than cell membranes made up of saturated fat or trans- fatty acids. A cell membrane working at optimal levels retains vital nutrients and electrolytes， has the ability to communicate with other cells and is responsive to hormones.Omega-3 fatty acids are also important components of substances known as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are important in immune function， smooth muscle function， platelet aggregation and inflammation. Fish oils have an anti-inflammatory action because prostaglandins and leukotrienes from omega-3 fatty acids have less inflammatory activity than prostaglandins and leukotrienes derived from other types of fatty acids.Fish oils appear to alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis due to the role of omega-3 fatty acids in suppression of the production of inflammatory compounds.Fish oil inhibits triglyceride synthesis in the liver and so helps to lower fats (triglycerides) in blood， therefore supporting a healthy cardiovascular system.* Omega-3s for those who don't eat enough fish* Maintains heart， brain and joint health* Odourless without the use of artificial surfactantsStore below 30 degree in a dry place away from direct sunlight.DosageAdults – Take 2 capsules a day with a meal.Children 2 - 12 years - Take 1 capsule a day (pierce and squeeze into milk， juice or cereal)， or as professionally prescribed.,Standard1 - 5 day(s)$1.49Cash on Delivery not availableEligible for Collection Point
